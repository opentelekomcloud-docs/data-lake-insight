Advantages
==========

Full SQL Compatibility
----------------------

You do not need a background in big data to use DLI for data analysis. You only need to know SQL, and you are good to go. The SQL syntax is fully compatible with the standard ANSI SQL 2003.

Decoupled Storage and Compute
-----------------------------

DLI compute and storage loads are decoupled. This architecture allows you to flexibly configure storage and compute resources on demand, improving resource utilization and reducing costs.

Serverless DLI
--------------

DLI is fully compatible with `Apache Spark <https://spark.apache.org/>`__ and `Apache Flink <https://flink.apache.org/>`__ ecosystems and APIs. It is a serverless big data computing and analysis service that integrates real-time, offline, and interactive analysis. Offline applications can be seamlessly migrated to the cloud, reducing the migration workload. DLI provides a highly-scalable framework integrating batch and stream processing, allowing you to handle data analysis requests with ease. With a deeply optimized kernel and architecture, DLI delivers 100-fold performance improvement compared with the MapReduce model. Your analysis is backed by an industry-vetted 99.95% SLA.

Cross-Source Analysis
---------------------

Analyze your data across databases. No migration required. A unified view of your data gives you a comprehensive understanding of your data and helps you innovate faster. There are no restrictions on data formats, cloud data sources, or whether the database is created online or off.
