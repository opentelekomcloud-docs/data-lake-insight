Quotas
======

What Is a Quota?
----------------

A quota limits the quantity of a resource available to users, thereby preventing spikes in the usage of the resource.

You can also request for an increased quota if your existing quota cannot meet your service requirements.

How Do I View My Quotas?
------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select **Region** and **Project**.

#. Click |image2| (the **My Quotas** icon) in the upper right corner.

   The **Service Quota** page is displayed.

#. View the used and total quota of each type of resources on the displayed page.

   If a quota cannot meet service requirements, increase a quota.

How Do I Apply for a Higher Quota?
----------------------------------

The system does not support online quota adjustment. To increase a resource quota, dial the hotline or send an email to the customer service. We will process your application and inform you of the progress by phone call or email.

Before dialing the hotline number or sending an email, ensure that the following information has been obtained:

-  Domain name, project name, and project ID

   Log in to the management console using the cloud account, click the username in the upper right corner, select **My Credentials** from the drop-down list, and obtain the domain name, project name, and project ID on the **My Credentials** page.

-  Quota information, including:

   -  Service name
   -  Quota type
   -  Required quota
