Changing the Database Owner on the DLI Console
==============================================

In practical use, developers create databases and tables, which are then handed over to testers for testing. Once testing is complete, the databases and tables are handed over to O&M personnel for experience. In this scenario, ownership of the data can be transferred to another owner by changing the database owner.

Changing the Database Owner
---------------------------

You can change the owner of a database on either the **Data Management** page or the **SQL Editor** page.

-  On the **Data Management** page, change the database owner.

   #. On the left of the management console, choose **Data Management** > **Databases and Tables**.
   #. On the **Databases and Tables** page, locate the database you want and click **More** > **Modify Database** in the **Operation** column.
   #. In the displayed dialog box, enter a new owner name (an existing username) and click **OK**.

-  Change the database owner on the **SQL Editor** page.

   #. On the left of the management console, click **SQL Editor**.
   #. In the navigation tree on the left, click **Databases**, click |image1| on the right of the database you want to modify, and choose **Modify Database** from the shortcut menu.
   #. In the displayed dialog box, enter a new owner name (an existing username) and click **OK**.
