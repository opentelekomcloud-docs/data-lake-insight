Deleting a Database on the DLI Console
======================================

You can delete databases as needed.

Precautions
-----------

-  You are not allowed to delete databases or tables that are being used for running jobs.
-  The administrator, database owner, and users with the database deletion permission can delete the database.

   .. note::

      If a database or table is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Exercise caution when performing this operation.

Deleting a Database
-------------------

#. On the left of the management console, choose **Data Management** > **Databases and Tables**.
#. Locate the row where the target database locates and click **More** > **Drop Database** in the **Operation** column.

   .. note::

      You cannot delete databases that contain tables. To delete a database containing tables, delete the tables first.

#. In the displayed dialog box, click **Yes**.
