Changing the Table Owner on the DLI Console
===========================================

In practical use, developers create databases and tables, which are then handed over to testers for testing. Once testing is complete, the databases and tables are handed over to O&M personnel for experience. In this scenario, ownership of the data can be transferred to another owner by changing the table owner.

Changing the Table Owner
------------------------

#. In the navigation pane on the left of the console, choose **Data Management** > **Databases and Tables**.
#. Click the name of the database whose tables you want to modify.
#. Locate the table for which you want to change the owner, click **More** in the **Operation** column, and select **Modify Owner**.
#. In the displayed **Modify Owner** dialog box, enter a new owner name (an existing username) and click **OK**.
