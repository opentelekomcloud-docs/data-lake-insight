Importing Data to OBS
---------------------

DLI enables direct access to data stored in OBS for query and analysis, eliminating the need for data migration.

To begin using DLI for data analysis, just import your local data into OBS.

Configuring DLI to Read and Write External Data Sources
-------------------------------------------------------

If you prefer not to import data into OBS or DLI tables, DLI offers cross-source access capabilities, allowing you to connect to data sources for analysis without the need to migrate the data.

For details, see :ref:`Configuring DLI to Read and Write External Data Sources <dli_01_0635>`.
