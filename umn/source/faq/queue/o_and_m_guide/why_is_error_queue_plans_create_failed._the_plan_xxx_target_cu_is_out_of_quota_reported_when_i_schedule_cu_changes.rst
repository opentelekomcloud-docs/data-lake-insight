Why Is Error "Queue plans create failed. The plan xxx target cu is out of quota" Reported When I Schedule CU Changes?
=====================================================================================================================

Scenario
--------

**Queue plans create failed. The plan xxx target cu is out of quota** is displayed when you create a scheduled scaling task.

Solution
--------

The CU quota of the current account is insufficient. You need to apply for more quotas.
