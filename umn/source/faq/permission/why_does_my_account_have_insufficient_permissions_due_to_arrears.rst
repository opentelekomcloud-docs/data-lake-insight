Why Does My Account Have Insufficient Permissions Due to Arrears?
=================================================================

When you submit a job, a message is displayed indicating that the job fails to be submitted due to insufficient permission caused by arrears. In this case, you need to check the roles in your token:

-  **op_restrict**: The account permission is restricted due to insufficient balance. If the current account balance is insufficient, all online user tokens under that account will be revoked. If they log in again, the **op_restrict** permission is added to the obtained tokens, limiting their operations.
-  **op_suspended**: Your account is suspended due to arrears or other reasons. If the current account is in arrears, all online user tokens under that account will be revoked. If they log in again, the **op_suspended** permission is added to the obtained tokens, limiting their operations (excluding cloud service users).

If the two roles described about are in your token, user operations are restricted.
