Why Can't I Query Table Data After I've Been Granted Table Permissions?
=======================================================================

The table permission has been granted and verified. However, after a period of time, an error is reported indicating that the table query fails.

There are two possible reasons:

-  The granted permission has been canceled.
-  View the table creation time to check whether the table is deleted or re-created by others. If it has been deleted or re-created, the permission becomes invalid.
