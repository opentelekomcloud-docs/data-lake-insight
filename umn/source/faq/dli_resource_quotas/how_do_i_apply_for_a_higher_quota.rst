How Do I Apply for a Higher Quota?
----------------------------------

The system does not support online quota adjustment. To increase a resource quota, dial the hotline or send an email to the customer service. We will process your application and inform you of the progress by phone call or email.

Before dialing the hotline number or sending an email, ensure that the following information has been obtained:

-  Domain name, project name, and project ID

   To obtain the preceding information, log in to the management console, click the username in the upper right corner, and choose **My Credentials** from the drop-down list.

-  Quota information, including:

   -  ServiceName
   -  Quota type
   -  Required quota
