How Do I Synchronize DLI Table Data Across Regions?
===================================================

You can use the cross-region replication function of OBS. The procedure is as follows:

#. Export the DLI table data in region 1 to the user-defined OBS bucket.
#. Use the OBS cross-region replication function to replicate data to the OBS bucket in region 2.
#. Import or use the corresponding data as required.
