Why Am I Seeing the Error Message "The current account does not have permission to perform this operation,the current account was restricted. Restricted for no budget" When Executing a SQL Statement?
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================

Symptom
-------

Error message "The current account does not have permission to perform this operation,the current account was restricted." is reported during SQL statement execution.

Solution
--------

#. Check the account status.

   Check if your account is in arrears and top it up if necessary.

#. Relog in to the system.

   If the same error message persists after the top-up, log out of your account and log back in.
