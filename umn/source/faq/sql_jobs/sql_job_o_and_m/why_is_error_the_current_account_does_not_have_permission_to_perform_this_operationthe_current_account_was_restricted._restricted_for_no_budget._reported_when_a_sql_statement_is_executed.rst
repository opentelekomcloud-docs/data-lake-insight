Why Is Error "The current account does not have permission to perform this operation,the current account was restricted. Restricted for no budget." Reported when a SQL Statement Is Executed?
==============================================================================================================================================================================================

This message indicates that your operation is restricted because your account is in arrears or there is insufficient balance in your account.

Solution:

#. Check the account status.

   Check if your account is in arrears and top it up if necessary.

#. Relog in to the system.

   If the same error message persists after the top-up, log out of your account and log back in.
