Why Is Error "path obs://xxx already exists" Reported When Data Is Exported to OBS?
===================================================================================

This message indicates that you are exporting data to an existing OBS path.

Solution:

-  Create an OBS directory.

   You can create an OBS directory that does not exist to store the data to be exported.

-  Delete the existing OBS directory.

   Deleting an existing OBS directory will also delete all data in the directory. Perform this operation with caution.

-  Check permissions on the directory.

   Make sure you have the permission to access and write data to the OBS path. If you do not have the permission, contact the administrator to obtain it.
