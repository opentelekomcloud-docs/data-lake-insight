How Is a Message Displayed Indicating That the SMN Topic Does Not Exist When I Use the SMN Topic in DLI?
========================================================================================================

When you set running parameters of a DLI Flink job, you can enable **Alarm Generation upon Job Exception** to receive alarms when the job runs abnormally or is in arrears.

If the SMN topic you select for your DLI job does not exist, log in to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) console, select the user group to which the IAM user belongs, and add the SMN policy for your region to the group.
