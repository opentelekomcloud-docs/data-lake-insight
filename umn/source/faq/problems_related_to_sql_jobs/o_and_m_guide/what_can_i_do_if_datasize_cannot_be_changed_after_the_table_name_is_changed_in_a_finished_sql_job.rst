What Can I Do If datasize Cannot Be Changed After the Table Name Is Changed in a Finished SQL Job?
==================================================================================================

If the table name is changed immediately after SQL statements are executed, the data size of the table may be incorrect.

If you need to change the table name, change it 5 minutes after the SQL job is complete.
