How Can I Use DLI If Data Is Not Uploaded to OBS?
=================================================

Currently, DLI supports analysis only on the data uploaded to the cloud. In scenarios where regular (for example, on a per day basis) one-off analysis on incremental data is conducted for business, you can do as follows: Anonymize data to be analyzed and store anonymized data on OBS temporarily. After analysis is complete, export the analysis report and delete the data temporarily stored on OBS.
