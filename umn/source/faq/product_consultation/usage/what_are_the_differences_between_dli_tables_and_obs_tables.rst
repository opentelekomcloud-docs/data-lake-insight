What Are the Differences Between DLI Tables and OBS Tables?
===========================================================

-  DLI tables store data within the DLI service, and you do not need to know the data storage path.
-  OBS tables store data in your OBS buckets, and you need to manage the source data files.
-  Different from OBS tables, DLI tables give you more permission control and cache acceleration functions. The performance of DLI tables is better than that of foreign tables, but you will be charged for the storage.
