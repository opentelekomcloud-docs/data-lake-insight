Can a Member Account Use Global Variables Created by Other Member Accounts?
===========================================================================

No, a global variable can only be used by the user who created it. Global variables can be used to simplify complex parameters. For example, long and difficult variables can be replaced to improve the readability of SQL statements.

The restrictions on using global variables are as follows:

-  Only the user who creates a global variable can use the variable.
-  Only the user who creates a global variable can modify the variable.
-  Only the user who creates a global variable can delete the variable.
