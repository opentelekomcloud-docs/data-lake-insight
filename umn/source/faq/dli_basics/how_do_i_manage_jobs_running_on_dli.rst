How Do I Manage Jobs Running on DLI?
====================================

To manage a large number of DLI jobs, you can use the following methods:

-  **Manage jobs by group.**

   Group tens of thousands of jobs by type and run each group on a queue.

-  **Create IAM users.**

   Alternatively, create IAM users to execute different types of jobs.

In addition, DLI also provides job management functions, including editing, starting, stopping, deleting, exporting, and importing jobs. You can use these functions to regularly maintain and manage jobs.
