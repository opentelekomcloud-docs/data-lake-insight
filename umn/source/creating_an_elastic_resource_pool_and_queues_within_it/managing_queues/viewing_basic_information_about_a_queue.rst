   The parameters of the queue are:

   -  **Engine**: type of the engine that executes jobs on the queue.
   -  **Default Version**: default version of the execution engine or the version the system will use if no specific version is specified.
   -  **Supported Versions**: all versions supported by the execution engine. By viewing the supported versions of the queue, you can find out which versions of the execution engine can be used to process jobs on the queue.
