DLI Console Overview
====================

The **Overview** page of the DLI console provides you with the DLI workflow and resource usage.

How to Use DLI
--------------

The process of using DLI is as follows:

#. **Create a queue.**

   Queues are computing resources of DLI. There are queues for SQL jobs and for general purpose. You can submit Spark SQL jobs only to SQL queues, and Spark programs, Flink SQL jobs, and Flink Jar jobs to general queues.

#. **Prepare data.**

   Create databases and tables before you run a Spark SQL job. Upload a program package before you run a Spark job or a Flink Jar job.

#. **Edit and submit a job.**

   After you set the job parameters, you can submit the job.

#. **View job status.**

   Go to the **Job Management** page to view the job execution status.

Queue Usage (hours)
-------------------

The overview page provides usage durations of all queues or a specific queue.

-  Usage Usage (hours): an overview of the usage of all resources.
-  Selected Queue Usage (hours): recent usage of a single queue.
