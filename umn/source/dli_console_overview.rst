DLI Console Overview
====================

The **Overview** page of the DLI console provides you with the DLI workflow and resource usage.

How to Use DLI
--------------

The process of using DLI is as follows:

#. **Create a queue.**

   Queues are DLI's compute resources. There are SQL queues and general-purpose queues. For a SQL queue, you can only submit Spark SQL jobs. For a general-purpose queue, you can submit Spark programs, Flink OpenSource SQL jobs, and Flink Jar jobs.

#. **Prepare data.**

   Create databases and tables before you run a Spark SQL job. Upload a program package before you run a Spark job or a Flink Jar job.

#. **Edit and submit a job.**

   After you set the job parameters, you can submit the job.

#. **View job status.**

   Go to the **Job Management** page to view the job execution status.

Queue Usage (hours)
-------------------

The overview page provides usage durations of all queues or a specific queue.

-  Usage Usage (hours): an overview of the usage of all resources.
-  Selected Queue Usage (hours): recent usage of a single queue.
