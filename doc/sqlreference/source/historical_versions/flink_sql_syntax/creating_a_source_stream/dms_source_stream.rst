DMS Source Stream
=================

DMS (Distributed Message Service) is a message middleware service based on distributed, high-availability clustering technology. It provides reliable, scalable, fully managed queues for sending, receiving, and storing messages. DMS for Kafka is a message queuing service based on Apache Kafka. This service provides Kafka premium instances.

The source stream can read data from a Kafka instance as the input data of jobs. The syntax for creating a Kafka source stream is the same as that for creating an open source Apache Kafka source stream. For details, see :ref:`Open-Source Kafka Source Stream <dli_08_0239>`.
