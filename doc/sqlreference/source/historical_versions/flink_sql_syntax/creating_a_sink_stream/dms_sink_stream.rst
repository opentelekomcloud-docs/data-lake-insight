DMS Sink Stream
===============

DMS for Kafka is a message queuing service based on Apache Kafka. This service provides Kafka premium instances.

DLI can write the job output data into the Kafka instance.

The syntax for creating a Kafka sink stream is the same as that for creating an open source Apache Kafka sink stream. For details, see :ref:`MRS Kafka Sink Stream <dli_08_0254>`.
